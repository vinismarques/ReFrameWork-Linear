# ReFrameWork-Linear

This is a modified version of UiPath's Robotic Enterprise Framework made for working with processes that are linear/non-transactional.

To start using the **ReFrameWork-Linear** it is possible to clone this repo and use it as a base for your project or, a cleaner way, get the template `.nupkg` file of the [latest Release](https://github.com/vinismarques/ReFrameWork-Linear/releases/latest).

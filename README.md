# Robotic Enterprise Framework - Linear

This is a modified version of UiPath's Robotic Enterprise Framework made for working with processes that are linear/non-transactional.

To start using the **reframework-linear**, clone this repo and use it as a base for your project or, a cleaner way, get the template `.nupkg` file of the [latest Release](https://github.com/vinismarques/reframework-linear/releases/latest) and add it to UiPath (further instructions available on the Releases page).
